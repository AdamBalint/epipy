I have been collecting a line list of MERS cases using publicly available data
like [WHO Disease Outbreak News reports](http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/).
Where possible, I've been trying to piece together human to human clusters -
it's guess-work at best, and I can't promise it's anything close to being correct.
