It contains (or will contain...)\r\ntools for analyzing and visualizing epidemiology data.\r\n\r\n###What is a case tree plot?\r\n\r\nI came up with case tree plots as a way to visualize zoonotic disease.\r\nHowever, it can also be used to visualizing environmentally-acquired\r\ndieases, or anything that emerges multiple times, is passed from person\r\nto person, and then dies out. Tweets and retweets might be a useful\r\nnon-epi example.\r\n\r\n###How do I read a case tree plot?\r\n\r\nThe x axis is time of illness onset or diagnosis, and the y axis is\r\ngeneration. Nodes at generation 0 are known as index nodes.\r\nIn the case of a zoonotic disease, the index node is a human case\r\nacquired from an animal source. If that human were to pass\r\nthe disease to two other humans, those two subsequent cases are both\r\ngeneration 1.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the color of the node varies based on the node attribute.\r\nIn many cases, color just signifies membership to a particular human to\r\nhuman cluster. However, it could also represent health status (e.g. alive, dead),\r\nthe sex of the patient, etc. \r\n\r\n###What is a checkerboard plot?\r\n\r\nCheckerboard plots display similar data as a case tree plot, but instead\r\nof a network it shows a simple time series for each human to human cluster.\r\nIt does not attempt to determine the structure of the transmission network.\r\n\r\nThe number in the center of each check is the case id that corresponds\r\nto the the line listing. I have not yet figured out how to display these\r\nnumbers so they don't overlap. Sorry.\r\n\r\n###I have a question/complaint/compliment.\r\nContact me at cmrivers@vbi.vt.edu, or @cmyeaton.
